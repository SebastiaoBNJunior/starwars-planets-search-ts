  <h1>🌌 Starwars Planets Search 🚀</h1>
</div>


During my study period at Trybe Programming School, I focused on learning Context API and React Hooks, which led to the development of a significant project.

This project consists of an application that communicates with an external API to retrieve information about various planets from the Star Wars universe.

Upon receiving data from the API, I utilized it to create an interactive table equipped with filters that allow users to search for planets by name and specific characteristics such as population, orbital period, diameter, among others.

Furthermore, as part of the development process, I created unit and integration tests using the React Testing Library, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the system.
